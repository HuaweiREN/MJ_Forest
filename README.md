Introduction
MJ_forest is a WeChat Mini-game with round-based strategy and education experience. 
In this mini-game, the player target at utilizing different methods to collect the resources (food & gold) as much as possible. The resources are again can be used to “gamble” with other players in an open market, or to grow up their pets. A higher level pet would bring back better talents and earn more feedbacks via pet’s activity. All the players would be ranked through their pets’ level and experience.
The whole game is a metaphor to people’s daily life. Somehow we are using our resources to earn our individual/family a better living environment. Furthermore, parts of them are eager to be outstanding, which means either they would have massy resources, or they would make themselves / their children being the best among the living circle. Thus, if we make a projection to this mini-game, we will find that the resources (in reality) are pointing at the food/gold (in game). They or their children (in reality) are pointing at the pet level and experience (in game).
The mini-game has 3 major systems and 10+ minor subsystems. 
The major systems include: 
1.	A demand-supply equilibrium model, 
2.	An activity-feedback close loop, 
3.	AI (with DQN loaded) robot model.

2.	A “barn” (where player can get their harvest day award)

4.	An underground market (where player can trade their resources within friend circle rather than put them into the world trade pool)
5.	A welfare system (where player can get some resources welfare if they meet some specific requirements)
6.	A calendar system (where there is a time projection between the real time and the game time)
7.	A user task system (where player are able to get extra resources after finishing some specific tasks)
8.	A pet dictionary system (where all the pets introduction and talents are listed)
